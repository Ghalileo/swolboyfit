            Evidence-based, research-based – call it what you want. It means utilizing the research process at all levels of the coaching process to ensure we’re actually making progress.

It starts with the foundational knowledge of strength training and relevant nutrition/conditioning practices. Understanding the latest in strength and nutrition research allows us to use real scientific data to build you a plan based on what we know generally works to help most people get stronger and more muscular. This is the key to a solid foundation for your training plan.

We build on that foundation filling in the gaps with real-world “research” from my experiences as a coach, and the vast experience of other coaches. Academic research can’t tell us everything, and we have decades of knowledge from high-level coaches all over the world, as well as my past experience with clients to help us fill in the gaps with best practices. This is invaluable data to create a fully fleshed-out program that we know will work for you, based on what we've seen work for others in the past.

Finally, there’s what’s often referred to as the “N=1” data – where you are the subject, and your training program is the research! The fact is that  research is limited, giving us very generalized information. Academic and experiential data give you a great place to start, but can only get you so far as a unique individual. Any good coach knows that training someone is a journey of trial and error, in order to learn what works best for each client and athlete along the way. Once we build your plan, we will work together to find what works and doesn’t work specifically for you. We'll watch what happens and learn from it, and make changes along the way based on what the data – your progress and performance – shows us.

            Being client-centered means it’s all about you and meeting your goals. “Individualization” is more than a buzzword for me. Through years of both teaching martial arts and helping people with their lifting goals, I’ve personally seen that you cannot do the exact same thing for two people and expect it to work for both. This is why I see our coach-client relationship as a team - with you, your programming, and your goals as the subject of our research – working together to find out exactly what works for you.

I always have every client start with a thorough application form before we even meet, followed by a consultation video call. These are both essential, because it’s extremely important that I take the time to understand you – who you are, your needs and goals, and what else you’ve got going on in your life besides just lifting. All of these things can and will impact you in the gym, and over time, the outcome of your goals. Getting a thorough base understanding of you early on and keeping a consistent, honest, open line of communication all along the way allow us to optimize your training plan within the context of your life.

Clients know deep down what they need and what’s best for them, even if they haven’t quite figured it out yet. My role as a coach is to support and guide you while bringing that inner self-knowledge to the surface, and applying it to your programming and training.

More than anything, I truly believe I can learn as much from my clients as they do from me, if not more. I build a relationship with every athlete, and we work together to bring the best out of you, in and out of the gym.

          <p class="mb-1">
            The fitness industry is notorious for using training ideologies and nutrition practices that can lead everyone from high-level athletes to everyday trainees into unhealthy mentalities about fitness. There’s a reason so many athletes confront injuries, mental health struggles, body image issues, high levels of stress and anxiety, hard and fast burnout, and more from something that is supposed to be fun and good for you. Even most coaches and personal trainers experience high rates of burnout because of these same unhealthy and neurotic traditions, practices, and ideologies.

I genuinely believe bodybuilding and strength goals shouldn’t have to put your health at risk or disrupt your life. It should bring you a sense of fulfillment, self-empowerment, and confidence. Your program and coach should work to grow and sustain your positive mental, physical, and emotional health over the long-term, concurrent with your training program. This is why I utilize sustainable coaching systems and training practices to keep you in the iron game for longer.

Training is important, but so is the rest of your life outside the gym. No matter how your life might change or what you’ve got going on, we’ll change the plan to make sure you can work towards your lifting goals and still maintain a balance between training and the rest of your life.

Let’s make sure your motivations for lifting are rooted in joy and excitement, not shame or guilt. Working towards goals are instrumental, but I also want to help you learn to love the experience of lifting weights, getting stronger, and/or building muscle. Let’s learn to love the process, so that it becomes a lifelong practice that makes your life better – not cause you to burn out.

              Anyone and everyone should have access to high-quality strength and physique coaching. You can rest assured you’ll have a coach that will hear you out and do their best to meet you where you’re at.

              We’ll make sure your training and programming is accessible and meets your needs. I won’t ever claim to be an expert on the myriad of ways that our bodies show up and move in the world, or pretend to know everything. But as your coach, I can guarantee that I will always hear you out and work with you. With me there are never any gendered assumptions, and you can always be transparent with me about your needs when it comes to training, and your expectations of me as your coach.
              
              I am constantly pursuing an ongoing education to better serve all of my current and potential future clients, and continue making changes to my practice to become more accessible and affirming. No trainer or coach knows everything, but I can say that I’ll always do the work to be better for my clients.
              
              More than anything, if I feel like I’m out of my depth or you aren’t satisfied with working with me, I won’t leave you hanging. I’ll make sure to redirect you toward another affirming and accessible coach that can adequately meet your needs – no judgement, no shame, no questions asked.
              
              Critically, I will not turn away clients due to lack of funds. All of my services are available at a sliding scale, and I ask those who can afford the higher rates (which I already try to keep relatively low), to please pay at the higher end. Paying at the top end of the sliding-scale covers the cost of coaching for those who cannot afford the higher rates. This helps me keep my promise of ensuring my coaching services are accessible to everyone.
              
              If for any reason you cannot afford the lower end of the sliding scale, please feel free to reach out to me directly by emailing natveiga@udel.edu with the subject line “Sliding Scale Coaching” and we will figure something out that works for you.

                    Hey there! My name is nat, and I’m the coach behind SBF. I made my debut in fitness at 13 when I went to my first tae kwon do class - after having spent my entire childhood hating every sport I tried up to then – and the rest is history. I spent seven years working to be one of the top students in my studio to the rank of 3rd degree black belt, getting my instructor certification along the way and teaching for over 5 years. This is where my love of teaching movement was born.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I loved everything about teaching martial arts – not only because I enjoyed the process and it made me a better student, but because I loved watching my students break plateaus and get better over time. I was fascinated by how each student responded uniquely to different training techniques and became amazing athletes through their own journey, and I loved getting to be the mentor that helped them get there. I have carried all of those experiences over into now being a strength and physique coach.
                    Eventually I swapped martial arts for lifting weights, and I remember feeling helpless having to maneuver the gym space almost completely by myself. I loved lifting, but the gym environment made me feel self-conscious and was full of a toxic culture that had me giving myself a pep talk every time I walked in. I felt so small, surrounded by guys twice my size. On top of that, it took me years to figure out what I was doing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I got my personal training certification and started SBF with the intent of being for other people what I wish I had my first several years of training. I wish I had had guidance and support – a mentor that would help me with my programming, tweak my technique, know the research, and throw around ideas when I hit a plateau. More than that, I wish I had someone that knew what it was like to be a very visibly queer and trans in that space. Someone who knew what it was like to be stared at because you’re the pipsqueak at the gym, or because you were unapologetically androgynous, but just wanted to focus on the iron and get swole like everyone else.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    I call myself “Smol Boy” because that’s how all my college pals referred to me: I was the smallest one in the group, but I had the biggest muscles. Small + Swole = Smol! Thank goodness they called me that, because I used to feel so insecure about being the smallest and queerest bro in the gym. Now, it’s a symbol of pride.
