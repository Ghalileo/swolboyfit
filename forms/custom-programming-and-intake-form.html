It may seem a bit lengthy, but it is important that I get as much information from you as possible now, so we can spend our first video consultation setting up your plan. Many of the nutrition questions are optional, should you not feel comfortable responding to some of them. Please remember, however, that the more information I have the better I can help you progress on your fitness plans and meeting your goals, so please set aside 30 minutes or so to answer these questions as thoroughly as possible. Afterward, you will be able to pay and schedule our first video consultation.
